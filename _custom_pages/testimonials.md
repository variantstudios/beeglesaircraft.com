      Beegles Aircraft is the ultimate airframe shop for you aircraft. Be it
      repair, restoration or a modification, their staff has the most experience
      and performs the best job period! Other shops talk about precision and/or
      "attention to detail'" but at Beegles, you really get it. I highly
      recommend them.

      Think you can no longer find Professionalism, Pride in Workmanship, Great
      Customer Service and Attention to Detail? At any price? At Beegles you can
      expect all of the above and more - for a reasonable price. When my
      Skywagon got hurt in California I thought long and hard about having it
      repaired locally. Fortunately, I followed the right advice and gave the
      job to Beegles instead.. N5468E has been to Beegles twice in her 26-some
      years in service: she looks and flies as good as new.

      All I can tell you is that if you want perfect work, Beegles is the place
      to go. I hit a deer with the left wing on our 2002 Baron. The paint scheme
      on the wing tip is 4 different colors and they matched it perfectly. The
      damage was repaired and pictures were emailed to me showing the progress.
      They took care of ferry permits to fly the plane out, returned it in
      perfect condition and topped it off with fuel when they brought it back.
      Their work was excellent. I spent 3 days doing research on where the best
      place to have our plane fixed and they met my expectations. Oh-and the
      final bill was less than the estimate!

      I want to thank you all for the excellent repair job you did our Baron,
      This aircraft has been involved in at least 3 gear up or partial gear up
      landings, and ever since the first one 7 years ago, it has not flown
      straight. We attribute that to a less than satisfactory repair job by one
      of your competitors in Arkansas. Now the plane flies as if it were brand
      new! In Addition to having repaired all of the damage, it is now in
      perfect trim and balance. I commend you on your exceptional quality of
      work and thank you for a job well done. I would be happy to recommend you
      to other potential customers.

      Sheet metal work was done by Beegles in Colorado. As best as I can tell,
      they have done a fine job. Cosmetics look good. She flies straight (hands
      off) and hasn't slowed down a bit. I regularly spoke with Scott and he was
      always polite and very patient. I hope to never do business with these
      folks again, but if I do, Iâ€™ll go back there.

      If you want to make a good plane better, go to Beegles and use their
      airframe experience with the Cessna Skywagon for the latest performance
      mods, airframe service kits, aircraft weighing, aircraft rigging, engine
      mount fitting and installation, and sheet metal repairs.

      The quality of repair is 1st rate, the airplane was ready on time and was
      even washed. Phone calls were promptly returned, and Scott went out of his
      way to make sure I was taken care of. You may or may not know that
      everything I just mentioned is unusual in the world of piston aviation!
      There are no "squawks" now after putting about 10 hours on the plane.
