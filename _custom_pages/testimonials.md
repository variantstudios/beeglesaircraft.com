      Beegles has worked on my 1956 Cessna 180 three times and each time their
      service and follow up was outstanding. Scott and the whole staff represent
      the best in service and knowledge especially of 180/185 aircraft. I would
      trust no one else to care for my pride and joy of 31 years now! Just talk
      to Scott and you will instantly be at ease and know you can trust this
      shop to deliver what you expect. On my last visit I had them do a gear
      alignment and frankly the airplane has never had ground handling this good
      EVER.

Extremely high standards combined with decades of collective knowledge ensure that they do it right every time.

      We worked with this shop (Scott) when our C310 received hail damage. They
      are absolutely #1 in customer service. They truly care about each and
      every one of their customers, new or old. They are also very accommodating
      to any needs you may have. Highly recommend.

      I wanted to drop you a quick note, thanking you for the repair job and
      detailing you and your crew did for my Meridian. It exceeded all my
      expectations. My wife and I went to the hanger Saturday to clean the bugs
      off after our trip home and upon further review, I didn't find anything
      that wasn't done to perfection on the entire aircraft.

      My summary of Beegle's is this. They under promise and over deliver. I now
      have a much better plane than I had before. I'm sure that part of the
      speed increase is due to the rigging that Beegle's did, because now it
      flies better than before.

      I wanted to personally acknowledge you and your team at Beegles Aircraft
      Service for the fine workmanship on my plane. This was a very stressful
      issue and you made it seamless for me to schedule the repairs, work with
      the insurance carrier and ultimately expedited the return of my plane. Not
      to mention, you could never tell that the plane had incurred hangar
      damage, as your repair work is exemplary. Beegles lived up to its
      reputation as a 'first class' operation and I wanted you to hear it from
      me.

      The quality of repair is 1st rate, the airplane was ready on time and it
      was even washed. Phone calls were promptly returned, and Scott went out of
      his way to make sure I was taken care of. You may or may not know that
      everything I just mentioned is unusual in the world of piston aviation!
      There are no "squawks" now after putting about 10 hours on the plane.

      Sheet metal work was done by Beegles in Colorado. As best as I can tell,
      they have done a fine job. Cosmetics look good. She flies straight (hands
      off) and hasn't slowed down a bit. I regularly spoke with Scott and he was
      always polite and very patient. I hope to never do business with these
      folks again, but if I do, I’ll go back there.

    testimonial_subtitle: Beech Baron  November 2004

      All I can tell you is that if you want perfect work, Beegles is the place
      to go. I hit a deer with the left wing on our 2002 Baron. The paint scheme
      on the wing tip is 4 different colors and they matched it perfectly. The
      damage was repaired and pictures were emailed to me showing the progress.
      They took care of ferry permits to fly the plane out, returned it in
      perfect condition and topped it off with fuel when they brought it back.
      Their work was excellent. I spent 3 days doing research on where the best
      place to have our plane fixed and they met my expectations. Oh-and the
      final bill was less than the estimate!

      I want to thank you all for the excellent repair job you did our Baron,
      This aircraft has been involved in at least 3 gear up or partial gear up
      landings, and ever since the first one 7 years ago, it has not flown
      straight. We attribute that to a less than satisfactory repair job by one
      of your competitors in Arkansas. Now the plane flies as if it were brand
      new! In Addition to having repaired all of the damage, it is now in
      perfect trim and balance. I commend you on your exceptional quality of
      work and thank you for a job well done. I would be happy to recommend you
      to other potential customers.

      Think you can no longer find Professionalism, Pride in Workmanship, Great
      Customer Service and Attention to Detail? At any price? At Beegles you can
      expect all of the above and more - for a reasonable price. When my
      Skywagon got hurt in California I thought long and hard about having it
      repaired locally. Fortunately, I followed the right advice and gave the
      job to Beegles instead.. N5468E has been to Beegles twice in her 26-some
      years in service: she looks and flies as good as new.

      Beegles Aircraft is the ultimate airframe shop for you aircraft. Be it
      repair, restoration or a modification, their staff has the most experience
      and performs the best job period! Other shops talk about precision and/or
      "attention to detail" but at Beegles, you really get it. I highly
      recommend them.
