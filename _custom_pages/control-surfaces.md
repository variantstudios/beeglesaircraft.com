Beegles Aircraft Service LLC takes great pride in our ability to repair control surfaces.&nbsp; Surfaces are inspected, repaired and corrosion proofed. Once completed they are reinspected for condition and conformity.

When you receive a repaired control surface from us it will be accompanied with Beegles Aircraft Service work order paperwork and the FAA Form 8130-3.

We have jigs to maintain proper twist and washout of surfaces.

We have made it a priority to increase our control surface inventory to save you time by having surfaces on hand when you need them. &nbsp;If we donâ€™t have one on-hand, we are probably capable of rebuilding yours.

We also offer painting services and do stock unpainted and pre-painted surfaces. &nbsp;If you purchase a pre-painted surface or have us paint one, we will balance the surface as well.

Additionally, we have rebuilt gear in stock.&nbsp;

All our surfaces and gear are listed on Parts Base.

If interested in purchasing a surface or having yours rebuilt, please click the Request a Quote Link (upload pictures if wanting rebuilt) and we will get back to you.
