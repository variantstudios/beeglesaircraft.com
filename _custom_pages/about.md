### History

Beegles Aircraft Service was founded by Ed Beegles in 1946 in Greeley, Colorado. Ed had recently returned from active duty with the U.S. Navy during WWII when he began converting WWII trainers into crop dusters. During the 50’s and 60’s, Beegles Aircraft evolved into a major airframe structural repair facility. Ed Beegles retired in 1979, but still enjoys flying and working on his Luscombe T8F as a certified A&P and IA at the age of 83.

After 60 years of business, Beegles Aircraft has completed repairs to over 10,000 damaged aircraft and has continued to exceed industry standards. With a highly trained staff of 25 employees, and over 400 years of combined experience, Beegles is revered as an industry leader by both aircraft owners and insurance companies.
