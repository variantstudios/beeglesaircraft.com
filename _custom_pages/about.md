Beegles Aircraft Service was established in 1946 by Edward Beegles Greeley, Colorado. Ed had recently returned from active duty with the U.S. Navy during WWII when he began converting WWII trainers into crop dusters. During the 50’s and 60’s, Beegles Aircraft evolved into a major airframe structural repair facility. Ed Beegles retired in 1979. Ed remained active in the aviation community and was inducted into the Colorado Aviation Hall of Fame in 1988 and awarded the Charles Taylor Master Mechanic Award in 2001. Ed’s prized Luscombe T8F continues to fly and is displayed inside the Greeley-Weld County airport terminal building. Ed left us on Christmas Eve of 2011 and will continue to fly for eternity!

Ray Burnham started his aviation career at age 14, working at his family engine overhaul shop that specialized in Pratt & Whitney R-985 engines. After high school Ray joined the US Navy and served on submarines for three years. In 1969 Ray returned home and went to work for Beegles Aircraft. In 1979 Ed Beegles retired and sold the company to Ray. The company continued to grow under Ray and provided outstanding service to customers and the aviation insurance industry with aircraft retrieval and airframe repair services. With the completion of the new shop building in 2004, the company expanded to over 35,000 square feet of hangar space dedicated to major airframe repairs, Beegles Aircraft Service became one of the leading airframe repair shops in the USA. Ray retired in March of 2018 and spends his free time pursuing his love of old Fords and Labs. Ray was subsequently awarded the Charles Taylor Master Mechanic Award in 2018.

 

After 70 years of business, Beegles Aircraft has completed repairs to over 12,000 damaged aircraft and has continued to exceed industry standards. With a highly trained staff of 25 employees, and over 400 years of combined experience, Beegles is revered as an industry leader by both aircraft owners and insurance companies.
